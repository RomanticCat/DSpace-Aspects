      The format used by all keys is as follows

      xmlui.<Aspect>.<Java Class>.<name>

      There are a few exceptions to this nameing format,
      1) Some general keys are in the xmlui.general namespace
         because they are used very frequently.
      2) Some general keys which are specific to a particular aspect
         may be found at xmlui.<Aspect> without specifiying a
         particular java class.
